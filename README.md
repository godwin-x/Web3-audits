# Web3 Audits
Welcome to my Web3 Audits repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey, learnings, and findings in the field of Web3 security and smart contract auditing. 

Here, you'll find detailed reports of my audit process, insights into vulnerabilities, and useful resources for enhancing blockchain security.

# About This Repository
This repository serves as a portfolio of my work as a Web3 security researcher, showcasing audit reports, vulnerability findings, and security tools developed throughout my journey.

# Contents
 * **Audit Reports**: Detailed reports on smart contract audits, covering vulnerabilities, recommendations, and remediation steps.
 * **Vulnerability Write-ups**: Summaries and explanations of vulnerabilities discovered during audits, including:
 * Issue Description
 * Potential Impact
 * Steps to Reproduce
 * Recommended Fixes
 * **Resources**: Links to useful resources, tools, and references that I frequently use for Web3 audits.
 * **Scripts & Tools**: Custom scripts and tools developed to assist with vulnerability discovery and testing.

# Approach to Auditing
Each audit conducted follows a methodical approach to uncover security flaws and optimize contract robustness:

 1. **Understanding the Contract**: Thorough review of the contract‚Äôs purpose, mechanics, and intended functionality.
 2. **Manual Code Review**: Line-by-line inspection to identify logical flaws, misuse of functions, and possible exploits.
 3. **Automated Testing**: Utilizing tools (e.g., Mythril, Slither) to scan for common vulnerabilities.
 4. **Fuzz Testing**: Applying randomized inputs to uncover edge-case issues.
 5. **Reporting & Recommendations**: Detailed documentation of findings, categorized by severity, along with recommended fixes.

# Tools & Technologies
This repository includes audits for smart contracts written primarily in Solidity (v0.8.0). Below are some of the core tools and frameworks used:

* **Slither**: Static analysis tool for Solidity.
 * **Mythril**: Security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts.
 * **Echidna**: Fuzzing tool for testing smart contract behavior.
 * **Foundry**: Test framework and toolkit for Ethereum.

# Future Plans
As I continue my journey in Web3 security, I plan to:

* Explore new blockchain ecosystems and their unique security considerations.
* Develop and share custom scripts to streamline vulnerability testing.
* Engage in community discussions, conferences, and audits to expand my knowledge base.
